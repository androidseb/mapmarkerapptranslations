Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time for over 4 years now.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，谢谢您的好奇心！

我以前在这里有一个广告横幅，因此我决定尝试一些不同的方法，并用此简单消息替换它…

我除了业余时间之外，还业余时间制作了这个应用程序，结果发现它成了一个附带项目，我花了很多时间在4年以上的时间里。

我希望您喜欢该应用程序并发现它有用。我这样做的方式是，您仍然可以无偿地做所有事情，这可能需要更多的工作。您可以自由地手动导入或导出数据，因此您无需支付任何费用，只是云同步更加方便。

如果您喜欢该应用程序，请为其提供支持：您不必为此花钱，这些行为都可以帮到我：
- 与您周围的人谈论该应用
- 评价应用程序以在商店中推荐它
- 购买高级升级（将删除底部横幅）

如果您不喜欢该应用程序，请给我发电子邮件（在“关于”里），并让我知道如何改进它。我走到了这一步，这要归功于许多用户的反馈，他们告诉我他们想要的或者不喜欢的东西，我会回复每封电子邮件，所以请不要害羞！

最后，感谢您阅读此:-)

问候
塞巴斯蒂安 | Sébastien
