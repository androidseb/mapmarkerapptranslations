The default search experience is not optimal, but it works without configuration.

If you use search a lot, it is strongly recommended to configure a third party search source to benefit from better search results.

It should only take a little bit of your time and will allow you to benefit from much better search results for free.

Click the "Change source" button and then the "Tutorial" option to learn more.
```

默认搜索体验不是最佳选择，但无需配置即可使用。

如果您经常使用搜索，强烈建议配置第三方搜索源，以从更好的搜索结果中受益。

您只需花费一点时间，即可免费获得更好的搜索结果。

点击“更改源”按钮，然后点击“教程”选项以了解更多信息。

Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time since early 2014.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，谢谢您的好奇心！

我曾经在这里有一个广告横幅，我决定尝试一些不同的东西，并用这个简单的信息代替它……

我在业余时间制作了这个应用程序，除了有一份全职工作之外，它还变成了我自 2014 年初以来花了很多时间的副业。

我希望您喜欢这个应用程序并发现它很有用。我这样做的方式是您仍然可以不付钱做任何事情，它可能只需要多做一点工作。您可以自由地手动导入或导出数据，因此您无需支付任何费用，只是云同步更方便。

如果您喜欢该应用程序，请支持它：您不必为此花钱，任何这些行为都有帮助：
- 与您周围的人谈论该应用程序
- 评价应用程序以在商店中推荐它
- 购买高级升级（将删除底部横幅）

如果您不喜欢该应用程序，请给我发电子邮件（在“关于”部分），让我知道如何改进它。感谢许多用户的反馈，他们告诉我他们错过或不喜欢什么，我能走到这一步，我会回复每封电子邮件，所以不要害羞！

最后，感谢您阅读此:-)

此致
塞巴斯蒂安 | Sébastien
