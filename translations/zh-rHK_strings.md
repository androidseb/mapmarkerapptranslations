Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time for over 4 years now.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，謝謝你的好奇心！ 
 
我以前在這裡有一個廣告橫幅，我決定嘗試不同的東西，並用這個簡單的消息替換它... 
 
我作為業餘愛好在我的空閒時間製作了這個應用程序除了有一份全職工作，事實證明它已經成為一個我已經花了很多時間超過4年的副項目。 
 
我希望你喜歡這款應用並發現它很有用。我以某種方式製作它，你可以在不付錢的情況下完成所有工作，它可能只需要更多的工作。您可以手動導入或導出數據，因此您永遠不必付費，只是云同步更方便。 
 
如果您喜歡該應用程序，請支持它：您不必花錢，任何這些手勢都有幫助： 
 - 向您周圍的人談論應用程序
 - 評價應用程序推薦它在商店
 - 購買高級升級（將刪除底部橫幅） 
 
如果您不喜歡該應用程序，請email me （來自“約”部分）讓我知道如何改進它。我已經走到這一步了，感謝許多用戶的反饋，他們告訴我他們錯過或不喜歡什麼，我回复每一個email ，所以不要害羞！ 
 
最後，感謝您閱讀此:-) 
 
問候
 sSébastien

The default search experience is not optimal, but it works without configuration.

If you use search a lot, it is strongly recommended to configure a third party search source to benefit from better search results.

It should only take a little bit of your time and will allow you to benefit from much better search results for free.

Click the "Change source" button and then the "Tutorial" option to learn more.
```

默認搜索體驗不是最佳，但無需配置即可運行。

如果您經常使用搜索，強烈建議您配置第三方搜索源，以便從更好的搜索結果中受益。

它應該只花一點時間，讓您免費獲得更好的搜索結果。
