## Translation Key: compass_calibration_help_part_1
```
In order to get the proper north direction for the compass, you need to calibrate you device properly.
To calibrate your device, simply move it around by drawing a 8. The move must be wide and repeated about 3 times for better efficiency.
You can calibrate you device by doing this at any time.
```
translated (by human 👀) as:
```
為了得到正確指南針方向，你需要正確校正你的手機。只需透過8字形移動並重複3次左右。您可以在任何時候做該動作校正你的手機。
```


## Translation Key: compass_calibration_help_part_2
```
The calibration has its limitations and might not be enough to counter nearby interferences such as :
• big metal objects
• electronic devices
• magnets
• the inside of a car/bus/train/plane
```
translated (by human 👀) as:
```
校正有其局限性，可能是不足以抵銷附近的干擾，如：大型金屬物體、電子設備、磁鐵、位於汽車/巴士/火車/飛機內部

Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time for over 4 years now.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，謝謝你的好奇心！ 
 
我以前在這裡有一個廣告橫幅，我決定嘗試不同的東西，並用這個簡單的消息替換它... 
 
我作為業餘愛好在我的空閒時間製作了這個應用程序除了有一份全職工作，事實證明它已經成為一個我已經花了很多時間超過4年的副項目。 
 
我希望你喜歡這款應用並發現它很有用。我以某種方式製作它，你可以在不付錢的情況下完成所有工作，它可能只需要更多的工作。您可以手動導入或導出數據，因此您永遠不必付費，只是云同步更方便。 
 
如果您喜歡該應用程序，請支持它：您不必花錢，任何這些手勢都有幫助： 
 - 向您周圍的人談論應用程序
 - 評價應用程序推薦它在商店
 - 購買高級升級（將刪除底部橫幅） 
 
如果您不喜歡該應用程序，請email me （來自“約”部分）讓我知道如何改進它。我已經走到這一步了，感謝許多用戶的反饋，他們告訴我他們錯過或不喜歡什麼，我回复每一個email ，所以不要害羞！ 
 
最後，感謝您閱讀此:-) 
 
問候
 sSébastien

If you use search a lot, it is strongly recommended to configure a third party search source to benefit from better search results.

It should only take a little bit of your time and will allow you to benefit from much better search results for free.

Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time since early 2014.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，謝謝你的好奇心！

我曾經在這裡有一個廣告橫幅，我決定嘗試一些不同的東西，並用這個簡單的信息代替它......

我在業餘時間製作了這個應用程序，除了有一份全職工作之外，它還變成了我自 2014 年初以來花了很多時間的副業。

我希望你喜歡這個應用程序並發現它很有用。我這樣做的方式是你仍然可以不付錢做任何事情，它可能只需要多做一點工作。您可以自由地手動導入或導出數據，因此您無需支付任何費用，只是云同步更方便。

如果您喜歡該應用程序，請支持它：您不必為此花錢，任何這些手勢都有幫助：
- 與您周圍的人談論該應用程序
- 評價應用程序以在商店中推薦它
- 購買高級升級（將刪除底部橫幅）

如果您不喜歡該應用程序，請給我發電子郵件（來自“關於”部分），讓我知道如何改進它。感謝許多用戶的反饋，他們告訴我他們錯過或不喜歡什麼，我能走到這一步，我會回复每封電子郵件，所以不要害羞！

最後，感謝您閱讀此:-)

問候
塞巴斯蒂安
